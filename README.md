Hospital Management System and ATM Simulation Projects

This repository showcases the functionality of two distinct projects developed using Java Spring Boot:
  •	Hospital Management System
  •	ATM Simulation

Hospital Management System
In today's fast-paced world, efficient healthcare management is critical. The Hospital Management System in this repository is designed to provide user-friendly software for managing hospital operations, including patient records, doctor schedules, and hospital staff information.

Objectives:
  •	Simplify the management of patient and staff records.
  •	Streamline daily hospital operations.
  •	Enhance the overall efficiency and productivity of healthcare institutions.
  •	This project serves as a practical tool for hospitals to handle their day-to-day activities seamlessly.

ATM Simulation
This project demonstrates the core functionality of an ATM system, providing a clear understanding of how basic ATM operations are implemented. The simulation includes:

Features:
  •	User Authentication:
  •	PIN validation.
  •	User ID verification.

Operational Options:
  •	Withdraw cash.
  •	Check account balance.
  •	Specify the amount for debiting.

The ATM simulation mimics real-world ATM workflows, showcasing essential banking functions in a secure and interactive manner.

Technologies Used
  •	Java
  •	Spring Boot
